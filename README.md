# paragraph_delay
Description
Python time method sleep() suspends execution for the given number of seconds. The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time.

The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that signal's catching routine.
